  # Sets up all CMake dependencies for a project by:
  #
  # 1. creating a directory to contain all CMake settings files (CMAKE_SETTINGS_DIR).
  # 2. installing all dependencies by running `DEP_TASK`.
  # 3. combining each dependency's settings file into a single settings file (CMAKE_SETTINGS_FILE)
  #    for use inside a CMake project.
  #
  # This task runs once per unique label, since a project should never repeat the same dependency
  # installation workflow (i.e. `DEP_TASK`) within a single task invocation. Additionally, if
  # multiple `DEP_TASK`s share the same `CMAKE_SETTINGS_DIR` and/or `CMAKE_SETTINGS_FILE`, we init
  # using helper tasks `misc:clear-dir` and `misc:clear-file` that themselves only run once per
  # unique directory/file path. This usage avoids race conditions and ensures that later dependency
  # tasks do not overwrite progress made by earlier ones.

  # - The task must not require any arguments (to use a task with arguments create a new task that
  #   calls the original with any arguments set).
  # - Dependencies must write their settings file to CMAKE_SETTINGS_DIR in order to have them
  #   included in CMAKE_SETTINGS_FILE.
  # @param {string} [CMAKE_SETTINGS_FILE={{.CMAKE_SETTINGS_DIR}}/all.cmake] The file in which to
